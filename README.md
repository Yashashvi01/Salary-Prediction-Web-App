This web application is designed to provide salary predictions for developers based on the Stack Overflow Developer Survey. By analyzing more than 70,000 entries contributed by developers from around the world, we have created a comprehensive salary prediction model that utilizes quantitative analysis. The web app is deployed on Streamlit, allowing users to access it through a live link.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this salary prediction model is derived from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey. It contains a wide range of information, including developers' demographics, education, programming languages, years of experience, job satisfaction, and, most importantly, their salaries. The dataset's extensive coverage allows for a thorough analysis of various factors influencing developer salaries.

## Quantitative Analysis

We conducted a quantitative analysis of the dataset to identify patterns and relationships between different factors and developer salaries. By leveraging techniques such as data exploration, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms, we developed a robust salary prediction model.

The analysis included examining factors such as education level, years of experience, job title, programming languages, and geographic location to understand their impact on salary. We identified key features that strongly correlate with salary and used them as inputs to train the prediction model.

## Web Application

The salary prediction web application provides an intuitive interface for users to obtain personalized salary estimates based on their specific circumstances. By inputting their information and preferences, users can receive a predicted salary based on the trained machine learning model.

The web app is deployed on Streamlit, a Python framework for creating interactive data apps. The user interface is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, enabling users to input their data effortlessly and receive instant salary predictions.
